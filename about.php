                  generation of young people equipped to walk uprightly in their
                  spiritual, professional, and social lives. Rooted in Biblical
                  principles, we strive to guide the youth toward a personal
                  relationship with Jesus Christ, empowering them to navigate
                  life’s challenges with faith, integrity, and responsibility.
                  Through our outreach programs across universities, high
                  schools, and primary schools, we bring a holistic approach to
                  spiritual growth and social impact. Inspired by the Five-Fold
                  Ministry, we focus on instilling moral values, fostering
                  emotional healing, and imparting professional orientation.
                  Together, we address the pressing issues of our time,
                  including substance abuse, violence, and relational
                  challenges, to build a resilient and empowered generation. I
                  invite you to join hands with us as we continue this
                  God-ordained mission. Let us walk together, uplifting our
                  youth to fulfill their divine purpose and positively impact
                  society for the glory of His Kingdom.

                  <p>FLY-M was founded in 1987 by Presbyter Kato, who initially received invitations to conduct pastoral programs in primary schools, starting with Moi Avenue Primary School in Nairobi.</p>

                  <p>Breach Repairers (BR) was founded in 2005 with the vision of promoting balanced living and addressing the challenges faced by students transitioning from high school to higher institutions of learning, such as newfound freedom and academic pressure. The club focuses on love, worship, intercession, and outreach, offering workshops, mentorship programs, and counseling to add value and foster excellence in students' lives. </p>

                  <h3 class="heading">FLY-M Junior Radicals</h3>
                  <p>FLY-M Junior Radicals (JR) was created in June 2017 as a WhatsApp group aimed at keeping students engaged during school holidays and after the KCSE exams. This initiative became especially important during the Covid-19 lockdown when schools across Kenya closed indefinitely. The prolonged closure posed unique challenges: parents weren’t accustomed to having students home for extended periods, and many students struggled with isolation, boredom, and negative influences such as crime, immorality, and addictions.
